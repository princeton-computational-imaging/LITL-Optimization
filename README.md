## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains the transient LiDAR simulator source code that was used to generate the realistic point cloud data. It does not contain the optimization algorithm and the object detector sources. The latter is based on the [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) library.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1) Install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

2) Execute the following commands.
```bash
# Create a new conda environment.
conda create --name litl_simulator python=3.8 -y

# Activate the newly created conda environment.
conda activate litl_simulator

# Clone this repository (including submodules!).
git clone git@github.com:princeton-computational-imaging/LITL-Optimization.git
cd LITL-Optimization

# Install packages
pip install .

# Install carla python interface
pip install carla-0.9.13-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
```

5) Enjoy


### Tutorials

There are 3 notebooks in the [tutorials](tutorials) directory which explains in details how to use this repository. To run them, execute the following commands:

```bash
# install jupyter notebooks
pip install notebook
# run jupyter in the tutorials directory
# this will open a browser window from which you can select the desired notebook
jupyter notebook tutorials
```

1) [part1_generate_raw_data.ipynb](part1_generate_raw_data.ipynb) explains how to generate raw data from the custom carla engine which can be downloaded using the link above. It also details how to run the docker image in order to visualize the scene from which the point clouds are generated in real time.
2) [part2_process_raw_data.ipynb](part2_process_raw_data.ipynb) shows how to use the various models implemented in this repo in order to generate realistic point clouds.
3) [part3_gui.ipynb](part3_gui.ipynb) discribes the special GUI developed to visualize the point clouds generated with this project.


### Disclaimer

The code has been successfully tested on
- Ubuntu 18.04.6 and 20.04 LTS + CUDA 11.3 + python 3.8
