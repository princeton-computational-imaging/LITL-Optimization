    "# LiDAR-in-the-loop Simulator GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this workshop, we assume you have gone through the 2 other workshops: the one for generating raw data `workshop_generate_raw_data` and the one to process data into point clouds using the python API `workshop_process_raw_data`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating processed data can be done via the API described in the previous workshop. Here we will describe a second way to generate it and to visualize at the same time!. There is an entrypoint coming with the\n",
    "`litl_simulator` library called `lidarsimgui`. Basically, it is a QT program which can be used to process raw data and visualize the processed point clouds. This takes the form as a command with some arguments.\n",
    "Its only mandatory argument is the frames directory that contains the raw data. Go ahead and try it!\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ lidarsimgui $CARLA_WORKSHOP_DATA\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is setup properly, you should see a window popping up. If you generated and saved processed data, you should see a main window that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Main lidarsimgui window at startup\" src=\"workshops_images/lidarsimgui_startup.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The window contains a 3D environement (which you can move around using the mouse and the `ctrl` key) where the point clouds will be displayed. There are a bunch of buttons which will be explained in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preset panel\n",
    "\n",
    "The presets buttons are the the buttons of the top row. From left to right, you first have:\n",
    "1. The preset selection arrows and dropdown menu. From these you can select the preset you generated for **for this particular frame**. You can swap in real time.\n",
    "2. The `Add/Edit` button makes the processing window appear (see below).\n",
    "3. The `Rename` button let's you rename a preset. The new name applies for all the frames.\n",
    "4. The `Delete` button let's you delete a preset. When deleting a preset, it will delete it for all the frames where it exists.\n",
    "5. The `Details` button shows you the parameters used to create the preset.\n",
    "6. The `Recompute` button allows you to recompute the preset for all frames. This is useful in case processing crashed or you modified the source code.\n",
    "7. Finally, the `Change cmap` button allows you to recompute the colormap  (does not apply for diffuse_color shader).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Window\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing point clouds is cool and all but how about generating a new processed point cloud. Using the `Add/Edit` button will show the processing window which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Preset processing window\" src=\"workshops_images/processing_window.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From this window you can compute a processed point cloud or change the parameters of an already existing one and recompute it. All parameters were already explained in the previous workshop. Note that list parameters to have a channel-wise control over parameters is currently not implemented through this GUI (TODO maybe??). To overwrite camera processed data or processed point cloud make sure to click the overwrite checkboxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can decide to only do processed point clouds for a limited number of frames. Just use the double slider at the top to decide which range of frames to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frame Panel\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and third rows of the main window describe the frame panel buttons. This set of buttons allows to jump between frames or to change frame. When changing frame, the viewer will try to stay on the same preset if it exists. Otherwise it will switch to another one available and if none exists, the processing window will pop up. For the second row from left to right:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `<<` jumps to frame 0.\n",
    "2. `<` and `>` switch to previous and next frame.\n",
    "3. `Play` button activates frame switching until the end at a given rate. Press button again to stop.\n",
    "4. `Pẗ size` selection changes the size of points in the processed point cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third row from left to right:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The frame slider allows you to quickly jump to a specific frame.\n",
    "2. The `Loop` checkbox allows to loop back at frame 0 when the end is reached.\n",
    "3. The `-` and `+` buttons controls the maximum rate at which frames are played. Note that loading point clouds is done 1 frame at a time (these things are quite heavy) and thus there is a minimal delay and it's impossible to go faster. That is why Max FPS will look capped.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Annotations Pannel\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth row in the main window allows to visualize the bounding boxes of objects. The `Show occluded bboxes` enables to see the bboxes which would be occluded because they are behind a wall or something. CARLA returns the bounding boxes of all objects in the world and, as such, there is an algorithm that decides which box to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Screenshot` button is self-explanatory. However the directory where the screenshots are stored is hard coded (>.<). Therefore, unless you change the path pressing this button will likely make the application crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Last Row\n",
    "\n",
    "The last row of buttons of the main window from left to right:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Cameras` opens the camera viewport (see below).\n",
    "2. `Waveforms` opens the waveform viewport (see below).\n",
    "3. `Make Movie` opens the movie making viewport (see below).\n",
    "4. `Skra Pop Pop` leaves the application (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_5oYU-IsU&ab_channel=MichaelDapaah)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Camera Viewport\n",
    "\n",
    "When pressing the `Cameras` button on the main window it opens the cameras viewport which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Camera viewport window\" src=\"workshops_images/camera_viewport.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where I am displaying the rgb image (default is depth map). This window allows you to see what the cameras grabbed during simulations. It is synchronized with the main window and, as such, when you switch frames or press the `play` button, the camera viewport will be updated as well. Here is a description of all items:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Project point cloud` checkbox projects the point cloud in camera viewport to see what it looks like from the point of view of the camera.\n",
    "2. `Projection color` arrows button change the color types of the point cloud projection.\n",
    "3. `Show annotations` checkbox prints out projected bounding boxes on the camera view.\n",
    "4. `Show hidden annotations` checkbox turns on or off seeing occluded bounding boxes.\n",
    "5. `3D bboxes` checkbox shows bbox projection in 2D or display 3D projections.\n",
    "6. `Image Filter` dropdown menu enables a color filter to see only a specific color channel or not.\n",
    "7. `Camera type` arrows selects the camera type to display.\n",
    "8. `Yaw angle` arrows selects the camera view angle.\n",
    "9. `Gamma` `-` and `+` button and `slider` adjust gamma (useful for depth map).\n",
    "10. `stick` checkbox keeps parameters accross frames.\n",
    "11. `Skra pop pop` button does the same thing as the same button of the main window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Waveform Viewport\n",
    "\n",
    "When pressing the `Waveforms` button on the main window, it opens the waveforms viewport which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Waveform viewport window\" src=\"workshops_images/waveform_viewport.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where here a point with 2 peaks is visualized. This viewport allows to visualize th wavefront for a given channel and a given point within this channel. Note that presets that did not use a waveform model will appear to have wavefronts that look dirac-like. It is possible to use the mouse and its wheel to pan the graph and zoom in/out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first block of widgets allows to customize the waveform on the fly. **Note that this will not change the resulting point cloud in the main window.** You will only see the result in the waveform window. This is useful for testing. To enable this feature, check the `Custom Parameters` checkbox and change the values in the line editors. Once this is done click the `Update` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other buttons description:\n",
    "1. `Show sub-waveforms` checkbox allows to display or not the sub waveforms that are summed to give the total waveform.\n",
    "2. `Point` arrows buttons and slider allows to change the point in the channel to view.\n",
    "3. `Laser` arrows buttons and slider allows to change the channel. Note that channel index = 0 refers to the channel with highest vertical angle.\n",
    "4. `Reset graph view` resets the axes.\n",
    "5. `PC Point size` `-` and `+` buttons and `slider` refers to the size of the points that targets the point cloud area you are viewing the wavefront of. Basically, when moving in the point cloud by changing the point and laser indices, you'll see in the main window's viewer points that depicts where you are located. Useful to choose which channel and point to visualize. You can adjust the point size of this target to see it better.\n",
    "6. `close`; self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Movie Maker Viewport\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the viewport that appears when clicking on the `Make Movie` button in the main window:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Make movie viewport window\" src=\"workshops_images/movie_maker.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This window let's you choose parameters to create a movie of the point cloud you are looking at! Choose an angle for viewing and start the process. Then, the play button will be triggered and each view will be recorded as a screenshot. Then the screenshots are compiled with `ffmpeg`. The resulting movie is stored in the `movie_frames` directory next to the frames containing raw and processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Add camera viewport to movie` checkbox enables a second movie to be recorded with screenshots of the camera viewport."
