    "Generating Raw Data Workshop\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "The `litl_simulator` python package does 2 things. First it generates raw data using the CARLA simulation environment. Secondly, it processes this raw data into waveforms which it then feeds to a simulated DSP that transforms them into a 3D point cloud + intensities. This notebook is dedicated to the first part which also explains how to setup CARLA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup CARLA\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using a customized version of CARLA in order to be able to return a fixed size raw point cloud array. Also, there is a customized shader within it that is used to compute realistic point cloud intensities. Everything has been compiled into a docker image (see README for download link).\n",
    " \n",
    "After a decade of download, you should be able to run the image straightforwardly. But first (on ubuntu), you need to allow the docker container to access the xhost. Then, you can boot the docker container which should display the default city (see image below).\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ xhost local:root \n",
    "$ docker run --user ue4 --privileged --gpus all --net=host -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw -e DISPLAY=:1 -e SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 carla_lidar_sim /bin/bash /home/ue4/carla/Dist/CARLA_Shipping_9071d25-dirty/LinuxNoEditor/CarlaUE4.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"workshops_images/boot_carla.png\" alt=\"What should appear when booting up CARLA image\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note here that the `--user ue4` option is mandatory since the unreal engine (the underlying engine ontop of which CARLA is built cannot run as root).\n",
    "\n",
    "From that point, it is possible to move around the world by using the ASDW keys and the mouse. Briefly, the CARLA engine works as a server which accepts commands from a specialized CARLA client. Since this workshop is not a tutorial on CARLA, please refer to [the CARLA documention](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in order to use this server. The only things different with the vanilla version of CARLA is the `semantic LiDAR` and the new camera blueprints called `diffuse_color` and `specular_metallic_roughness` which work the same way as the other cameras.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing to do is install the CARLA client python library specially built for this version of CARLA. It is stored at the top of this gitlab repo (`carla-0.9.13-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl`). Just install it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ pip install carla-0.9.13-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note, this python library only works for `python 3.8`. At any point, the only way to kill the CARLA server is by stopping/removing the container using `docker`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate Raw Data\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `lidar_carla_sim` python package has been developed to generate raw data using the CARLA client API. After `pip install`ing it and running the CARLA server in a docker container, it is possible to start simulating raw data."
